# Security Policy

## Scope

This project is a PS4 homebrew plugin that runs on consoles with [GoldHEN](https://github.com/GoldHEN/GoldHEN) installed. It does not connect to the internet, collect data, or interact with any external services.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue (e.g., a buffer overflow or memory corruption bug), please report it by opening a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Zenalios/ps4-thumbgrid-ime/issues).

Since this is an offline homebrew tool running in a sandboxed environment, there is no need for private disclosure — public issues are fine.
